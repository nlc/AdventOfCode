It looks like the function is acutally monotonic in (p1 * 100 + p2),
so we could have been a lot smarter than the meathead brute force
approach we actually took, but it did work.
If we were clever, we could have done some kind of binary search.
The dumb brute force attempt took several minutes (!) to get through
only a 100x100 space. How well would binary do?
